# gtback's awesome

My curated links, all in one place.

To be clear, the above is the possessive from of "gtback's" (i.e. "mine"), not the contraction "gtback is awesome", though if you'd like to think the latter, I certainly won't object. :smiley:

This started out of my desire to collect into one place the various bookmarks I have accumulated on a variety of different platforms, in a place where I can share with others. The existing "awesome" lists are just that, but I don't have time to look at all of the resources they list, and wanted a place for things I can personally vouch for the value of. 

Enjoy!

(actual content coming soon, I hope!)
